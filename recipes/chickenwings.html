        <h4>These chicken wings are surprisingly delicious for how few ingredients are involved! I made them for the first time at a football party, and within 10 minutes everyone had eaten all 5 pounds!  </h4>

        <h5>Ingredients</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups brown sugar </li>
            <li>1 cup yellow mustard </li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce </li>
            <li>5 pounds chicken wings, cut into thirds and tips discarded </li>
            
        </ul>

        <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix brown sugar, mustard, and soy sauce together in a bowl. Measure 1/4 cup marinade for basting and transfer to a small bowl; cover and refrigerate.</li>
            <li>Place wings in a large resealable bag. Pour remaining marinade over wings, coating well. Seal and marinate wings at least 2 hours and up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove chicken wings from resealable bag and transfer to a baking sheet. Discard marinade.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Baste wings with reserved 1/4 cup marinade; cook, basting every 10 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 more minutes.</li>
        </ol>
